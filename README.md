# weight_predictor
This code is written in Ocatve Language.<br/>
I run this code in Ocatve CLI<br/>
Ocatve is an easy language for complex mathematical calculations<br/>
Its similar to Matlab<br/>
I used the matrices manipulations to implement the algorithms.<br/>
It uses linear regression, a machine learning model to fit the training datasets using a weight optimization algorithm called Grdient Descent<br/>
which tries to minimize the loss function in order to fit the best with the model.<br/>
It basically moves towards the global minima.<br/>
This code used some Hyper Parameters like inital weights and learning rate.<br/>
Hyper Parameters are the parameters or weights that are used to fit the model with the data.These are choosen critically because the wrong values of these may leads the overfitting or worst fitting of the model.

you can observe the predicted weight is 43.051 for a person whose height is 1.5m. 
Its quite Accurate !.
